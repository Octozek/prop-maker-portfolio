    mainImageComment: "Here’s a fun shot of my Majora’s Mask prop with my frog chilling on it — definitely a seal of approval. I started this build by printing a 3D model of Majora’s Mask using my resin printer. After printing, I cleaned and fully cured it to prepare for finishing.",

      { id: 1, src: "/assets/masks/majoras-1.jpg", comment: "Once cured, I went in with a Dremel and wire brushes to add wood grain and natural texture to the surface — making it feel more organic and aged. Then I primed the whole thing to prep it for painting." },
      { id: 2, src: "/assets/masks/majoras-2.jpg", comment: "The back side is fully smoothed and finished, showing that I don’t skip out on details. Everything’s sealed and solid, so it’s good for display, cosplay, or just showing off." },
      { id: 3, src: "/assets/masks/majoras-3.jpg", comment: "This shot shows it side-by-side with three other Majora’s Mask versions I’ve made. Each one has its own unique vibe, but this one leans heavily into that rustic, hand-crafted style." },
      { id: 4, src: "/assets/masks/Keaton-2.jpg", comment: "Majora's Mask displayed next to the Keaton and Deku Masks, highlighting consistent craftsmanship across the collection with matching paint finishes and wood grain textures." },

Huge credit to FerreusVeritas for designing such an awesome file. If you want to check it out or print one for yourself, you can find the 3D model here:",

    mainImage: "/assets/masks/Deku-main.jpg",
    mainImageComment: "Here’s the front view of my Deku Kid Mask from Majora’s Mask. I started by 3D printing the base using resin, just like I did with my Majora’s Mask. After curing, I added wood-like textures with a Dremel and wire brushes to give it that natural, carved feel. The face was then primed and hand-painted with layers of color to match the look from the game.",
    images: [
      { id: 201, src: "/assets/masks/Deku-2.jpg", comment: "The back shows off more of the wood grain texture I carved in. The grooves and lines were added before painting, and I used a subtle drybrush technique to make the details pop. I also sealed the entire mask to protect the paint and texture." },
      { id: 202, src: "/assets/masks/Keaton-2.jpg", comment: "Here it is next to two of my other Majora’s Mask builds. The Deku Kid stands out with its earthy tones and leafy top — I used fake plants to give it that extra forest feel, adding a pop of green that brings the mask to life. It was a fun detail that really finishes the piece." },

    mainImageComment: "Here’s my finished Keaton Mask from Majora’s Mask! Just like my previous masks, I started by printing it in resin, then cured and cleaned it. I used a Dremel to carve in wood grain details across the surface to give it that handcrafted feel before priming and painting.",
    images: [
      { id: 401, src: "/assets/masks/Keaton-2.jpg", comment: "Here’s the Keaton Mask displayed alongside some of my other Majora’s Mask builds. It fits right in with the lineup — bold colors, clean lines, and all sealed up to protect the finish." },
      { id: 402, src: "/assets/masks/Keaton-3.jpg", comment: "This shot shows two Keaton Masks I made side-by-side. It’s always satisfying to see the consistency in shape, texture, and paintwork across multiple builds. Each one still has its own little bit of character, though." },

    mainImageComment: "This is my custom-made Mario Mask from The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask. I actually created the 3D model for this one myself! After designing it, I printed the mask on my resin printer, cleaned it up, and cured it fully before moving on to finishing work.",

      { id: 401, src: "/assets/masks/Mario-2.jpg", comment: "After curing, I added surface texture, then primed the whole mask to prep for paint. Here it is shown alongside two of my other Majora’s Mask builds — it fits right in, but definitely brings its own fun energy to the set!" },
      { id: 402, src: "/assets/masks/Mario-3.jpg", comment: "I painted this one using an airbrush to get smooth blends and bold color coverage, then sealed it with a clear coat to lock everything in. It’s lightweight, clean, and ready for cosplay or display." },

    mainImageComment: "Here’s my Goron Mask from The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask. I designed and modeled this one myself before printing it on my resin printer. After cleaning and fully curing the print, I started working on the surface texture to match the rocky look of the Goron race.",
    images: [
      { id: 501, src: "/assets/masks/Goron-2.jpg", comment: "This shot shows the depth and texture a bit better — I used a textured paint over the mask to give it a rough, stone-like surface. Once that dried, I went in with the airbrush to lay down the base color and added shading to bring out the facial features." },
      { id: 502, src: "/assets/masks/Goron-3D.jpg", comment: "Here’s the full 3D model I created for this mask before printing. After all the paintwork was done, I sealed the physical piece with a clear coat to protect the texture and lock in the finish. It’s got that perfect worn rock feel, just like a Goron should." }

    mainImageComment: "This is my custom Death Gun Mask from Sword Art Online. I printed the mask using my resin printer, then cleaned and sanded it down to a smooth finish. After that, I primed it with black paint to get a solid base coat before moving on to the weathering.",
    images: [
      { id: 601, src: "/assets/masks/deathgun-1.jpg", comment: "After priming, I drybrushed a metallic paint across the surface to give it that worn metal look — not too clean, just the right amount of battle-worn. It picks up great detail across the mask’s raised edges and texture." },
      { id: 602, src: "/assets/masks/deathgun-2.jpg", comment: "This side view shows the alternate black lens setup. I made the lenses from thin plastic, then wrapped them with a red or black sunglass tint depending on the client’s preference. They can swap out whichever color they like best." },
      { id: 603, src: "/assets/masks/deathgun-3.jpg", comment: "A closer look at the worn, metallic finish that gives the mask a battle-worn appearance." },

    mainImageComment: "This is my custom Jareth Mask from Labyrinth. I modeled it from scratch, keeping true to the elegant and mysterious look from the film. After printing it in resin and curing it, I carefully cleaned the surface to prep it for sanding.",
    images: [
      { id: 701, src: "/assets/masks/labyrinth-1.jpg", comment: "I sanded the entire mask smooth to remove any print lines or imperfections, making sure the final result would be super clean. The shape of the mask really comes through here — subtle, sharp, and sleek." },
      { id: 702, src: "/assets/masks/labyrinth-2.jpg", comment: "Once prepped, I used an airbrush to apply even coats of paint, building up soft tones and shadows to give it depth. The smooth surface helped the paint lay down flawlessly, capturing that crisp, theatrical vibe the mask is known for." },
      { id: 703, src: "/assets/masks/labyrinth-3.jpg", comment: "To finish it off, I applied a clear gloss coat to seal the paint and give the mask a polished, display-quality finish. The gloss also highlights all the sculpted details and gives it that professional, prop-ready look." },
