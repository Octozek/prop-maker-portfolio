    mainImageComment: "Here’s a fun shot of my Majora’s Mask prop with my frog chilling on it — definitely a seal of approval. I started this build by printing a 3D model of Majora’s Mask using my resin printer. After printing, I cleaned and fully cured it to prepare for finishing.",

      { id: 1, src: "/assets/masks/majoras-1.jpg", comment: "Once cured, I went in with a Dremel and wire brushes to add wood grain and natural texture to the surface — making it feel more organic and aged. Then I primed the whole thing to prep it for painting." },
      { id: 2, src: "/assets/masks/majoras-2.jpg", comment: "The back side is fully smoothed and finished, showing that I don’t skip out on details. Everything’s sealed and solid, so it’s good for display, cosplay, or just showing off." },
      { id: 3, src: "/assets/masks/majoras-3.jpg", comment: "This shot shows it side-by-side with three other Majora’s Mask versions I’ve made. Each one has its own unique vibe, but this one leans heavily into that rustic, hand-crafted style." },

Huge credit to FerreusVeritas for designing such an awesome file. If you want to check it out or print one for yourself, you can find the 3D model here:",

    mainImageComment: "Here’s the front view of my Deku Kid Mask from Majora’s Mask. I started by 3D printing the base using resin, just like I did with my Majora’s Mask. After curing, I added wood-like textures with a Dremel and wire brushes to give it that natural, carved feel. The face was then primed and hand-painted with layers of color to match the look from the game.",
    images: [
      { id: 201, src: "/assets/masks/Deku-2.jpg", comment: "The back shows off more of the wood grain texture I carved in. The grooves and lines were added before painting, and I used a subtle drybrush technique to make the details pop. I also sealed the entire mask to protect the paint and texture." },
      { id: 202, src: "/assets/masks/Keaton-2.jpg", comment: "Here it is next to two of my other Majora’s Mask builds. The Deku Kid stands out with its earthy tones and leafy top — I used fake plants to give it that extra forest feel, adding a pop of green that brings the mask to life. It was a fun detail that really finishes the piece." },

    mainImageComment: "Here’s my finished Keaton Mask from Majora’s Mask! Just like my previous masks, I started by printing it in resin, then cured and cleaned it. I used a Dremel to carve in wood grain details across the surface to give it that handcrafted feel before priming and painting.",

      { id: 402, src: "/assets/masks/Keaton-3.jpg", comment: "This shot shows two Keaton Masks I made side-by-side. It’s always satisfying to see the consistency in shape, texture, and paintwork across multiple builds. Each one still has its own little bit of character, though." },

    images: [
      { id: 601, src: "/assets/masks/Goron-2.jpg", comment: "This shot shows the depth and texture a bit better — I used a textured paint over the mask to give it a rough, stone-like surface. Once that dried, I went in with the airbrush to lay down the base color and added shading to bring out the facial features." },

      { id: 801, src: "/assets/masks/deathgun-1.jpg", comment: "After priming, I drybrushed a metallic paint across the surface to give it that worn metal look — not too clean, just the right amount of battle-worn. It picks up great detail across the mask’s raised edges and texture." },
