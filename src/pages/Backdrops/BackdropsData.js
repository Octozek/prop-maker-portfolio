    mainImageComment: "This is my Charcoal Ridge-style terrarium backdrop. It features a series of smaller rock shapes and layered ledges, giving it a more rugged and stacked look. I used the same process — carving foam, heat-treating it with a heat gun to create that hard, stone-like texture, and then prepping it for paint.",

      { id: 101, src: "/assets/backdrops/Charcoal-Ridge-1.jpg", comment: "Here you can see me using the airbrush to bring out the depth in all the cracks and crevices. I used Drylok mixed with acrylics for the base, then shaded the recessed areas with darker tones to make the textures pop. This backdrop has a cooler, grey-toned color palette to match the “charcoal” vibe." },
      { id: 102, src: "/assets/backdrops/Charcoal-Ridge-2.jpg", comment: "The client requested a more rocky bottom area, so I added more jagged texture and ledges toward the base. You can really see it here — rough, craggy, and perfect for climbing or resting. After all the paintwork, I sealed everything to lock in the finish and keep it durable for long-term use." },

    title: "Chipped Ridge Stone",
    mainImage: "/assets/backdrops/Chipped-Ridge-Stone-main.jpg",
    mainImageComment: "This is my Chipped Ridge Stone-style terrarium backdrop. I started by layering and gluing foam to build the structure, then carved in rocky shapes and natural breaks. After that, I used a heat gun to shrink and harden the surface, giving it a rough, realistic rock texture. For this one, I also used a heated knife to carve in deep cracks, giving it a more fractured, weathered look.",
    images: [
      { id: 103, src: "/assets/backdrops/Chipped-Ridge-Stone-1.jpg", comment: "Once carved and textured, I painted it with Drylok that I tinted using acrylic paints. I airbrushed darker tones into the deeper sections and cracks to give it more depth and shadow. The client wanted a slight gloss to make it look like a damp forest floor, so I sealed it with a glossier finish than usual to give it that wet stone effect." },

    mainImage: "/assets/backdrops/Pale-Carved-Rock-main.jpg",
    mainImageComment: "This is my Pale Carved Rock-style terrarium backdrop. I started by layering foam and carving out natural rock forms, then used a heat gun to give the surface a hardened, stone-like texture. The client specifically asked for one large gash on the left side of the wall, so I carved that in deep to give it a dramatic, weathered look. I painted it using Drylok mixed with light-toned acrylics for a pale stone appearance, followed by airbrushed shadows in the deeper areas. Finally, I sealed it to lock in the colors and protect the finish.",

    title: "Rusty Rock",
    mainImage: "/assets/backdrops/Rusty-Rock-main.jpg",
    mainImageComment: "This is my Rusty Rock-style terrarium backdrop. I started by layering multiple pieces of foam, then carved in deep ridges to create a rugged, natural look. After carving, I hit it with a heat gun — this shrinks and toughens the foam, giving it a rock-like texture and a hardened exterior.",
    images: [
      { id: 104, src: "/assets/backdrops/Rusty-Rock-1.jpg", comment: "From this angle, you can see the depth really come to life. After shaping and heat-treating the foam, I applied a base coat of Drylok mixed with acrylics. Then I used an airbrush to darken the deep crevices and shadowed areas, adding contrast and realism." },
      { id: 105, src: "/assets/backdrops/Rusty-Rock-2.jpg", comment: "To finish it off, I drybrushed lighter tones across the raised edges to highlight the textures and give it that final pop. Once the painting was done, I sealed the whole thing to protect the finish and keep it looking fresh long-term." },

    title: "Rusty Cliff Stone",
    mainImage: "/assets/backdrops/Rusty-Cliff-Stone-main.jpg",
    mainImageComment: "This is my Rusty Cliff Stone-style terrarium backdrop. I started by layering and carving foam to create a jagged cliff design with lots of natural ledges. The client wanted plenty of areas for their lizard to climb, so I focused on building out ledges and step-like ridges throughout. After carving, I used a heat gun to shrink and harden the foam, giving it that durable rock texture.",
    images: [
      { id: 106, src: "/assets/backdrops/Rusty-Cliff-Stone-1.jpg", comment: "Here you can see the side angle, where I applied a dark wash using watered-down black paint over the base colors. This helped deepen the shadows in the cracks and crevices and gave the whole piece a more weathered and realistic look. The orange tones still come through but now with more contrast and depth." },
      { id: 107, src: "/assets/backdrops/Rusty-Cliff-Stone-2.jpg", comment: "This final image shows the backdrop on my workbench before shipping. After painting, I drybrushed lighter highlights across the high points and sealed the whole piece to protect the finish. It’s ready for a reptile to climb, bask, and explore." },

    mainImage: "/assets/backdrops/Charcoal-Deep-Rock-main.jpg",
    mainImageComment: "This is my Charcoal Deep Rock-style terrarium backdrop. It’s a 4ft by 2ft build made with layered foam, carved to create a natural but simple rock layout, just like the client requested. After carving, I used a heat gun to give the foam a hardened texture and realistic rock finish. The color scheme is a cool, charcoal grey to keep things clean and natural.",
    images: [
      { id: 108, src: "/assets/backdrops/Charcoal-Deep-Rock-1.jpg", comment: "Here I’m using my airbrush to add depth and contrast to the piece. I painted the base using Drylok mixed with grey acrylics, then added darker tones in the crevices to bring out the natural details while still keeping that smooth, minimalist look the client wanted." },
      { id: 109, src: "/assets/backdrops/Charcoal-Deep-Rock-2.jpg", comment: "This last shot shows me airbrushing the piece at scale. You can see just how large this backdrop is in person. Once the shading was done, I sealed everything to protect the finish and keep it looking great inside the enclosure long-term." },

    mainImageComment: "This is my Pale Stone Formation-style terrarium backdrop. Built using layered foam, I carved out a natural rock layout and used a heat gun to give the surface a hardened, textured finish. The client specifically wanted a super light backdrop to contrast with their dark-colored snake, so I used a soft, pale paint mix — Drylok tinted with light acrylics — and airbrushed in subtle shadows to keep it natural-looking. The whole piece was sealed for long-term durability inside the enclosure.",
